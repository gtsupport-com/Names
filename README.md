The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive database of name
variants to include in searches whenever a particular name is searched.
It is a better name-matcher than Soundex.  Read more about the
[Variant names project](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/WeRelate:Variant_names_project)

This readme explains how to incorporate name variants into your own website.

Search module
=============

The search module contains everything you need to incorporate name variants into
your own website.

* _Normalizer.java_ - converts a user-entered text string to a normalized form -
converts non-roman characters to corresponding roman characters, removes noise
words, prepends surname prefixes, converts -dotter endings to -son, etc.
You must call this on user-entered text before calling any other function.
See _NormalizerTest.java_ for an example.

* _Searcher.java_ - the two main functions are _getAdditionalIndexTokens_ and
_getAdditionalSearchTokens_. See _SearcherTest.java_ for an example.

    * Each name should be indexed under its normalized form as well as any tokens
returned by _getAdditionalIndexTokens_. _getAdditionalIndexTokens_ returns the
soundex code for the name when the name rare. It does not return any tokens
otherwise.  Thus, most names require just a single token (the normalized name
itself), while some names require two tokens.

    * To return variants for a user-specified name at search time, search for
the normalized form of the user-specified name as well as additional tokens
returned by _getAdditionalSearchTokens_. On average, _getAdditionalSearchTokens_
will return 25-35 tokens to include in searches.

* _surnamePrefixedNames.txt_ contains a list of prefixed-surnames (e.g., McDonald),
and their unprefixed roots (e.g., Donald).  According to the labeled pairs
provided by Ancestry, unprefixed roots need to be included in searches for a
prefixed surname, and vice-versa. But determining whether a name is prefixed is
not easy.  That is, Vandyke and Ohare are prefixed, but Vance and Olson are not.
This table attempts to identify common prefixed surnames.  Rare surnames use
the prefix list in _searcher.properties_ to estimate whether they are prefixed.

* _givenname\_similar\_names.csv_ is a table of variants for the 70,000
most-frequent given names in Ancestry.com's database.

* _surname\_similar\_names.csv_ is a table of variants for the 200,000
most-frequent surnames in Ancestry.com's database.

Rare names not in the above tables appear less than once in every 5,000,000
names in Ancestry's database, are indexed under their Soundex code by
_getAdditionalIndexTokens_.  _getAdditionalSearchTokens_ includes these names by
including the Soundex code of the searched-for name as one of the tokens to search.

The above tables will be updated periodically to incorporate user modifications
made at the [Variant names project](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/WeRelate:Variant_names_project).
As part of this project, people are being encouraged not only to improve the names,
but also to review the changes made by others.  A changes log
(see [Changes log](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Special:NamesLog)) will be included
here so you can browse the changes.

_Searcher.java_ reads the two above tables to determine whether a name must be
indexed under a Soundex token (if it is not in the table), and what additional
names to include in searches.  If you don't want to use java, you could pretty
easily write your own code to read the two tables.

Installing the tables into a database
-------------------------------------

By default, _Searcher.java_ reads the above two tables into memory.  If you want to
read the tables from a database instead of reading them into memory, do the following:

    create table givenname_similar_names (
    name varchar(255) not null,
    similar_names varchar(4096) not null,
    primary key (name));

    mysqlimport --fields-enclosed-by='"' --fields-terminated-by=','
    --lines-terminated-by="\\n" --local <dbname> givenname_similar_names.csv

    create table surname_similar_names (
    name varchar(255) not null,
    similar_names varchar(4096) not null,
    primary key (name));

    mysqlimport --fields-enclosed-by='"' --fields-terminated-by=','
    --lines-terminated-by="\\n" --local <dbname> surname_similar_names.csv

In addition,

* copy c3p0.properties.example to c3p0.properties, customize it as needed, and make sure it is on your classpath

* copy db\_memcache.properties.example to db\_memcache.properties, customize it as needed, and make sure it is on your classpth

Building
--------

`mvn install` creates the normal jar file as well as one with all dependencies


Score module
============

The score module contains code to _score_ a pair of names: return a number
indicating how similar they are.

* _Scorer.java_ - contains the scoring function.  See _ScorerTest.java_ for an
example of use.  Remember to normalize the names beforehand.

* _DMSoundex.java_ - a simplified implementation of Daitch-Mokotov soundex

* _Nysiis.java_ - an implementation of NYSIIS

* _WeightedEditDistance.java_ - an edit distance algorithm, like Levenstein,
but where each edit is assigned a weight, where the weights have been learned
using an Expectation Maximization algorithm over the positive labled examples
provided by Ancestry.  By weighting edits, we can make the edit distance between
ACE and APE greater than the edit distance between ACE and ASE.

* _FeaturesGenerator.java_ - when name pairs are scored, a set of features is
generated for each pair.  These features include whether the NYSIIS codes match,
the Soundex codes match, the Refined Soundex codes match, the Daitch-Mokotov
codes match, the value of the Levenstein distance, and the value of the Weighted
Edit Distance.  The weights for each feature were learned by running the labeled
training data provided by Ancestry.com through [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
A number of other features were evaluated, but these features seemed to provide
the best results.

* _SimilarNameGenerator.java_ returns a set of names similar to the specified
name. See _SimilarNameGeneratorTest.java_ for an example.

* _givennameClusters.txt_ and _surnameClusters.txt_ - these files can be used
to speed up _SimilarNameGenerator_.  By clustering the names, rather than scoring
each name against the specified name to determine if it is similar, we can score
the cluster "centroids", and score the names in a cluster only if the centroid is
closer than a certain threshold.

* _cmulex\_lts.bin_ - this file was created by people at Carnegie Mellon University,
and is used by the FreeTTS library to convert name strings to phonetic values. The
phonetic values are used in WeightedEditDistance - it calculates the distance
between the phonemes.

You might be tempted to index each non-rare name under its cluster centroid,
so that you'd only have one token to look up at search time. You could do this, and
you'll get reasonable results. But you'll get better results using the approach
described in the search module.  The reason is that while name X might be similar
to name Y, and name Y might be similar to name Z, name X may not be very similar to
name Z.  In other words, similarity is reflexive but not transitive. Attempting to
cluster names and searching on cluster centroids only, assumes transitivity, which
doesn't exist.

Building
--------

Before building _Scorer.java_ you must install the customized freetts.jar and
William Cohen's secondstring library from the _external_ directory into your
local maven repository:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=score/external/freetts.jar -DgroupId=com.sun.speech -DartifactId=freetts -Dversion=1.2.2-threadsafe -Dpackaging=jar

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=score/external/secondstring.jar -DgroupId=com.wcohen.ss -DartifactId=secondstring -Dversion=20101021 -Dpackaging=jar

`mvn install` creates the normal jar file as well as one with all dependencies

Eval module
===========

Use this module if you want to evaluate the precision and recall of your own coder or
name variants tables against Ancestry's labeled pairs.

* _CodeEvaluator.java_ shows how to evaluate a code-based approach; modify this to
incorporate your coder.

* _TableEvaluator.java_ shows how to evaluate a table-based approach.

* _SimilarNameAdder.java_ is used to generate a core name-variants file based upon
names scoring above a certain threshold.

* _SimilarNameAugmenter.java_ adds additional names to a name-variants file.
If you had your own custom list of name variants, they could be added to the
core name-variants file using this function.
'''If you do have your own list of name variants, we hope you share them with us.'''

* _AncestryGivennamePairs.csv_, _AncestrySurnamePairs.csv_, and _BorderSurnamePairs.csv_
contain the labeled pairs provided by Ancestry.  However, BorderSurnamePairs was found
to not help, so it was not used.

* _givenname\_ancestry.txt_ and _surname\_ancestry.txt_ contain the positively-labeled
pairs from Ancestry's labeled data.

* _givenname\_behindthename.txt_ contains a set of related givennames graciously
donated by [BehindTheName.com](http://www.behindthename.com), an _excellent_ resource
for understanding how given names are related.  In particular, the file lists all
given names that are one "hop" away from the specified name in the "Family tree"
view at BehindTheName, are of the same gender, and are not an ancient or medieval name.

* _givenname\_nicknames.txt_ contains a set of nicknames.

* _givenname\_werelate.txt_ and _surname\_werelate.txt_ contain name pairs given by
users at WeRelate.org, the book "Dunkling, Leslie and William Gosling, _The New
American Dictionary of Baby Names_, published by Signet (New American Library), 1985",
and the book "Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges, _A Dictionary of Surnames_, Oxford
University Press, 1990."

* _givenname\_orig.csv_ and _surname\_orig.csv_ contain the original core of
the names-variants tables.

To create the name-variants tables in the search module, first, SimilarNameAdder
was used to add all names scoring above a threshold of 2.3
to each of the 70,000 most-frequent givennames and above a threshold of 0.7
to each of the 200,000 most-frequent surnames.  For performance reasons,
SimilarNameAdder adds considers only names greater than the specified name, so
SimilarNameAugmenter was used with the -p option to add the reverse pairs.

The result is stored in _givenname\_orig.csv_ and _surname\_orig.csv_.

At this point, the precision and recall of the name-variants tables against
Ancestry's labeled pairs were:

* Given names: P/R=97.4/71.6
* Surnames: P/R=89.4/76.4

Compared to Soundex:

* Given names: P/R=97.2/64.6
* Surnames: P/R=88.6/67.8

This represents a 20% decrease in false-negatives (names that should be searched
together but are not) for given names, and a 27% decrease in false-negatives for surnames.

Next, _givenname\_behindthename.txt\_, _givenname\_nicknames.txt_, and
_givenname\_werelate.txt_ were added to the given names table, and
_surname\_werelate.txt_ was added to the surnames table, using SimilarNameAugmenter
from the Score module. The options passed to SimilarNameAugmenter were:
* behindthename: -p -r
* nicknames: -a
* werelate: -p
At this point, the Precision and Recall of the name-variants tables against
Ancestry's labeled pairs were:

* Given names: P/R=96.8/74.4
* Surnames: P/R=89.2/76.8

So we end up with a 28% decrease in false-negatives for both givennames and surnames.

Finally, we added the positively-labeled training pairs: _givenname\_ancestry.txt_
and _surname\_ancestry.txt_ so the initial tables would be as complete as possible
to create the tables found in the Search module. User-modifications to these tables
as part of the [Variant names project](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/WeRelate:Variant_names_project)
will further modify, and hopefully improve, these tables.

If you want to re-create the P/R numbers above, you won't be able to test using the
name-variants files in the Search module, since they include the training data.
Instead, you'll need to start with the _givenname\_similar\_names\_orig.csv_ or
_surname\_similar\_names\_orig.csv_ file in this module and follow the process
outlined above. Then run _TableEvaluator.java_ with the "-t" option to pass in the
table you just created.

Also, if you use _TableEvaluator.java_ or _CodeEvaluator.java_ with
_AncestryGivennamePairs.csv_ or _AncestrySurnamePairs.csv_, you'll see some warnings
about invalid lines.  This is to be expected.  Some lines in the training data contain
invalid names, like "nn", which is an abbrevation for "no name," not an actual name.
The evaluators recognize this, skip over the line, and list it as a warning.

Service module
==============

Use this module if you want to generate search and index tokens or score names
by issuing REST calls.  This module allows you to use the Variant names project
as a REST service instead of as a library.

The service endpoints are:

* _index/type/name_ returns all tokens to index for the name.
* _search/type/name_ returns all tokens to search for the name.
* _score/type/name1/name2_ returns the score of name1 and name2

In all cases, type is either "givenname" or "surname".  You can request the result
as XML or JSON by requesting a content type of "application/xml" or "application/json".

Building
--------

`mvn package` creates a war file that you can deploy to a servlet container like Tomcat

Roadmap
=======

Overall, given names had an average of 32 variants, and surnames had an average
of 26 variants.  For search engines like
[Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html), that's not too bad,
because each variant lookup results in the union of a generally-small result set.
However, the most-frequent 1000 given names and surnames had an average of 61
and 51 variants respectively, which means that the most-frequently searched
names require a lot of extra lookups.

We can do better.

One thing that can be done to reduce the number of extra lookups necessary when
searching for variants is to cluster the variants into lots of
small clusters.  Then instead of looking up each variant separately,
_Searcher.getAdditionalIndexTokens_ would return the cluster code for each
name, and _Searcher.getAdditionalSearchTokens_ would return the distinct cluster
codes for each of the variants.  By clustering the names according to how
frequently they appear together as variants, we would expect the number of
distinct clusters for each set of variants to be much smaller than the
number of variants themselves.

Another approach would be to index names using a high-precision, low-recall
coder like Refined Soundex. Then at search time look up each of the distinct
refined soundex codes for the variants.

I'd love some help tackling this problem.  [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/)
looks like a good tool to generate clusters.
